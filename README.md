<h1>Undirected-Graph</h1>
<br></br>
Python implementation of an undirected graph, with support for path tracing and Dijsktra's Algorithm. This is less of a clone-and-run repo 
and more focused towards those who are either just starting out learning about graphs, graph theory, or computer science. Dijsktra's algorithm is 
implemented in an as-close-to-pseudo style to help with those coming from literature to code.
